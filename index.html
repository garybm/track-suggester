          <p>One day, <span class="person1"></span> and <span class="person2"></span> were walking through the woods, when suddenly a giant <span class="animal"></span> appeared. "<span class="exclamation"></span>", <span class="person1"></span> cried. The two of them <span class="verb"></span> as quickly possible, and when they were safe, <span class="person1"></span> and <span class="person2"></span> gave each other a giant <span class="noun"></span>.
          <p>We can’t hate you ‘cause you’re popular! JavaScript is used in over 92.6% of all websites as per some studies. Take any popular content platform like Google, Facebook, Twitter, Amazon, Instagram, NYTimes ... and you can bet that the front-end of its website uses JavaScript</p>

          <h1>C#!</h1>
          <p>C# is most popular among bigger established businesses, often for building internal software. Because it's been around for a long time and has the backing of Microsoft, it is one of the most in-demand languages in the job market. C# has also been going through a bit of a rebirth lately, with Microsoft open sourcing the language and surrounding platform, porting it to run on Mac and Linux, and incorporating many of the best features of other languages. If you like the idea of working for a larger company on business software, C# is a great choice.</p>

          <h1>PHP!</h1>
          <p>PHP is by far the most popular backend language today, with 80 percent of websites utilizing it 'server-side'. It is perhaps best known for it's use in content management systems like Wordpress, Drupal, and Joomla. But the versatility of the language and the frameworks it powers make employment options numerous and diverse. If you're keen to work for a fast paced agency that builds websites for lots of clients, or maintain the security and stability of a huge complex of government websites, or if you like the idea of building out small sites for brands, businesses, and organizations - In any of these cases, PHP would be a great way to go.</p>
